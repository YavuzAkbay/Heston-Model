## üßÆ Mathematical Foundation

The Heston model is governed by the following stochastic differential equations:

Price Process:
`dS(t) = rS(t)dt + ‚àöv(t)S(t)dW‚ÇÅ(t)`

Volatility Process:
`dv(t) = Œ∫(Œ∏ - v(t))dt + Œæ‚àöv(t)dW‚ÇÇ(t)`

Where dW‚ÇÅ(t) and dW‚ÇÇ(t) are correlated Brownian motions with correlation œÅ.
